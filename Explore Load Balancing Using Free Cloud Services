⭐ Explore Load Balancing Using Free Cloud Services
➤ Step 1: Deploy Two Identical Web Server Instances

• Launch two EC2 instances on AWS or two VM instances on Google Cloud.
• Choose a Linux OS (Ubuntu/Amazon Linux).
• Install a basic web app or Apache server on both:

sudo apt update
sudo apt install apache2 -y


• Edit the index page differently on each instance so responses are unique:

sudo nano /var/www/html/index.html


Example:
Instance 1 → “Server 1 Response”
Instance 2 → “Server 2 Response”

➤ Step 2: Configure Security Rules

• Allow HTTP (port 80) for both instances.
• Ensure both instances are reachable with their public IPs.

➤ Step 3: Create a Load Balancer
For AWS (ELB):

• Open EC2 → Load Balancers → Create Load Balancer
• Choose Application Load Balancer
• Set:
– Scheme: Internet-facing
– Listener: HTTP (80)
• Create or select a security group allowing HTTP
• Add both EC2 instances to the target group
• Register both instances
• Create the load balancer

For GCP Load Balancer:

• Go to Network Services → Load Balancing
• Create a new HTTP load balancer
• Add two backend instances to the backend group
• Configure frontend with global IP
• Deploy the load balancer

➤ Step 4: Test the Load Balancer

• Copy the Load Balancer Public URL / DNS name
• Open it in a browser several times
• Refresh the page to observe alternating responses:
– “Server 1 Response”
– “Server 2 Response”

This confirms traffic is being distributed across both servers.

➤ Step 5: Record Public URLs and Outputs

• Note the following in the lab notebook:
– Public IP of instance 1
– Public IP of instance 2
– Load Balancer Public URL
– Response output from both servers
• Take screenshots of:
– Load balancer configuration
– Registered instances
– Browser showing different server responses
