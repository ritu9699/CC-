Configure Multiple Virtual Machines on VirtualBox
➤ Step 1: Open Oracle VirtualBox

• Launch Oracle VirtualBox from the system.
• Ensure that at least one Linux ISO file (Ubuntu/CentOS) is available for installation.

➤ Step 2: Create the First Virtual Machine

• Click New and create VM-1 (Example: Ubuntu-VM1).
• Select OS type (Linux → Ubuntu 64-bit).
• Allocate RAM and CPU.
• Create a virtual hard disk.
• Attach the Linux ISO.
• Start the VM and complete OS installation.

➤ Step 3: Create the Second Virtual Machine

• Again click New and create VM-2 (Example: Ubuntu-VM2).
• Repeat the same process:
– Choose OS type
– Set RAM and CPU
– Create virtual disk
– Attach Linux ISO
• Start and install the OS.

➤ Step 4: Configure the Network Mode

• Select VM-1 → Settings → Network.
• Change Adapter 1 to Host-Only Adapter or NAT Network.
• Select VM-2 → apply the same network mode so both VMs are on the same network.
• Save settings.

➤ Step 5: Check Network Connectivity Between VMs

• Start both VM-1 and VM-2.
• Open terminal in each VM.
• Find IP address using:

ip a


• From VM-1, ping VM-2:

ping <VM2-IP>


• From VM-2, ping VM-1:

ping <VM1-IP>


• Successful ping confirms proper communication.

➤ Step 6: Demonstrate File Transfer Between VMs

• Use scp command for file transfer (example: copying a file from VM-1 to VM-2):

scp file.txt user@<VM2-IP>:/home/user/


• Enter the password when asked.
• Verify the file in VM-2 using:

ls

➤ Step 7: Capture Screenshots

• Take screenshots of:
– Network configuration in VirtualBox
– IP address outputs from both VMs
– Successful ping between VMs
– File transfer commands and results
