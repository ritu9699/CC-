Install Docker on Your System and Run a Container
➤ Step 1: Install Docker

• On Linux (Ubuntu), install Docker using:

sudo apt update
sudo apt install docker.io -y


• On Windows, install Docker Desktop from the official website and complete the setup.

➤ Step 2: Check Docker Installation

• Verify that Docker is installed correctly:

docker --version


• Start the Docker service if needed:

sudo systemctl start docker
sudo systemctl enable docker

➤ Step 3: Pull a Basic Docker Image

• Download the hello-world container image:

docker pull hello-world

➤ Step 4: Run the Container

• Execute the container:

docker run hello-world


• A message confirming successful installation will appear.

➤ Step 5: View Running and Stopped Containers

• To list all active containers:

docker ps


• To list all containers (including stopped):

docker ps -a

➤ Step 6: Check Container Logs

• View the logs of the hello-world container:

docker logs <container-id>


• Replace <container-id> with the ID shown from the docker ps -a command.

➤ Step 7: Capture Outputs

• Take screenshots of:
– Docker version
– Docker image pull
– Container run output
– Container list
– Container logs
